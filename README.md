# ledgerx-scraper


> A twitter bot that queries ledger X for daily volume data and posts it.

This bot started as practice with selenium after using it for a take home coding challenge for Plaid. It devolved into a deployment experiment, and I dabbled with cloud functions until I saw the light and realized that if I wanted to send the goodest tweets then I needed historical data. It's currently just a sqlite db tied to a series of python functions for POC. Since the only server I have running right now is written in javascript, I'll probably port this over to JS and throw in a cron job in order to post on a daily cadence.
